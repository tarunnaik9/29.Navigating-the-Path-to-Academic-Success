# Navigating-the-Path-to-Academic-Success
This project explores a machine learning-based approach to predicting and enhancing student academic performance. It combines educational psychology insights with data science to offer practical tools for both learners and educators.

# Project Summary
This system predicts academic performance using various input parameters related to a student's academic history. It helps identify areas needing improvement and provides data-driven feedback. The platform supports student success through:
1.Academic performance prediction using ML algorithms
2.Real-time data processing and visualization
3.Insights via performance graphs and pie charts
4.Simple web interface with login and dataset management

# Key Features
🔐 User Login: Secure login module (default: admin/admin)

📥 Dataset Upload & Processing: Load and view academic data

🧠 Train Machine Learning Models: Applies algorithms like XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, etc.

📊 Performance Prediction: Enter academic input and receive predicted outcome (Poor, Fair, Good)

📈 Graph Analysis: View comparative performance via charts

# Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML/CSS

Backend: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Platform: Windows (Python 3.7+)


# Results

The system successfully classifies academic performance into categories and helps students understand their standing. It supports early intervention strategies based on performance predictions.
